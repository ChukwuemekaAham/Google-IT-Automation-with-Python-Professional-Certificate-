## Final Project

In this module, you’ll put everything you’ve learned so far into action! You’ll apply your scripting knowledge to tackle a challenging final project: writing a script that scans for a specific error in the log files. You'll create a problem statement to understand the challenge, conduct some research to see what options are available, then begin planning how you intend to solve the problem. Lastly, you'll write the code to implement your solution!

### Key Concepts

* Approach the problem using the frameworks and best practices we’ve learned
* Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
* Create a planned approach to solve the problem
* Write a complex script which includes some of the skills we’ve learned in this course to solve this problem
