Hint: Use os.listdir() method for this, which returns a list of all files and directories in the specified path.

    You should now have a list that contains all of the feedback files from the path /data/feedback. 
    Traverse over each file and, from the contents of these text files, create a dictionary by keeping title, name, date, and feedback as keys for the content value, respectively.
